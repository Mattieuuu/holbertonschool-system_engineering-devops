User -> Internet -> DNS -> Server (8.8.8.8)
                                |
                          [ NGINX (Web Server) ]
                                |
                    [ Application Server (App Code) ]
                                |
                          [ MySQL Database ]

Infrastructure Explanation:

1. User Access Flow:
- User types www.foobar.com in their browser
- DNS resolution translates www.foobar.com to IP 8.8.8.8
- Request reaches the server through HTTP/HTTPS protocol

2. Server (8.8.8.8):
- Physical or virtual computer that hosts all components
- Runs Linux operating system
- Single point where all services are hosted

3. Domain Name (foobar.com):
- Human-readable address for accessing the website
- www record is an A record in DNS
- Points to server IP 8.8.8.8

4. Web Server (Nginx):
- Handles HTTP requests
- Serves static content
- Manages SSL/TLS termination
- Routes requests to application server

5. Application Server:
- Executes application code
- Processes dynamic content
- Handles business logic
- Communicates with database

6. Database (MySQL):
- Stores website data
- Manages user information
- Handles data persistence
- Processes data queries

7. Communication Protocol:
- HTTP/HTTPS protocol between user and server
- TCP/IP for network communication

Infrastructure Issues:

1. SPOF (Single Point of Failure):
- Single server hosts everything
- No redundancy
- Hardware failure = complete outage

2. Maintenance Issues:
- Updates require downtime
- No redundant server for failover
- Service restart = temporary outage

3. Scaling Limitations:
- No load balancing
- Limited by single server resources
- Cannot handle high traffic loads
- Vertical scaling only option
