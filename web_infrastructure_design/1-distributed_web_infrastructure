        - MySQL (Primary)           - MySQL (Replica)

Infrastructure Details:

1. Load Balancer (HAproxy):
- Distribution algorithm: Round Robin
- Alternates requests between servers
- Active-Active setup enabled
- Ensures high availability and load distribution

2. Server Configuration:
Server 1 (Primary):
- Nginx web server
- Application server
- Application codebase
- MySQL Primary database

Server 2 (Replica):
- Nginx web server
- Application server
- Application codebase
- MySQL Replica database

3. Load Balancer Setup:
- Active-Active: Both servers handle traffic simultaneously
- Differs from Active-Passive where one server is on standby
- Round Robin algorithm distributes requests evenly

4. Database Configuration:
Primary-Replica Relationship:
- Primary: Handles write operations
- Replica: Handles read operations
- Asynchronous replication from Primary to Replica
- Improved read performance and redundancy

Infrastructure Issues:

1. SPOFs:
- Load balancer is a single point of failure
- No redundancy for load balancer
- Single Primary database

2. Security Issues:
- No firewall protection
- No HTTPS encryption
- Exposed ports and services
- No network segmentation

3. Monitoring Limitations:
- No monitoring system in place
- No performance metrics
- No error tracking
- No uptime monitoring
