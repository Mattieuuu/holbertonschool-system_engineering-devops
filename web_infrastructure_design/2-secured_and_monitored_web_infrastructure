Infrastructure Components:

1. Security Elements:
- 3 Firewalls: Network security, traffic filtering
- SSL Certificate: HTTPS encryption
- Secure protocols and ports only

2. Server Configuration:
Each Server Contains:
- Nginx web server with SSL termination
- Application server
- Database (Primary/Replica)
- Monitoring client
- Firewall protection

3. Monitoring Setup:
- 3 Monitoring clients (one per server)
- Data collection: metrics, logs, performance
- QPS monitoring via Nginx logs
- Resource utilization tracking
- Alert system for anomalies

4. HTTPS Implementation:
- SSL/TLS encryption
- Secure data transmission
- Certificate validation
- End-to-end security

Infrastructure Issues:

1. SSL Termination Issues:
- Terminating at load balancer exposes internal traffic
- Need for end-to-end encryption
- Additional SSL overhead

2. Database Limitations:
- Single write point (Primary)
- Replication lag
- No write failover

3. Uniformity Problems:
- All servers have same components
- Resource competition
- No component isolation
- Difficult maintenance
