Infrastructure Components:

1. Load Balancer Cluster:
- HAproxy in active-active configuration
- Distributed traffic handling
- High availability and redundancy
- Automatic failover capability

2. Dedicated Web Server:
- Nginx for static content
- SSL termination
- Request routing
- Caching layer

3. Application Server:
- Isolated application processing
- Business logic handling
- Resource optimization
- Dedicated processing power

4. Database Server:
- Dedicated MySQL instance
- Optimized for data operations
- Independent scaling
- Resource isolation

5. Additional Server Benefits:
- Component isolation
- Independent scaling
- Resource optimization
- Improved maintenance
- Better security control

Component Distribution Benefits:

1. Performance:
- Dedicated resources per component
- Optimized configurations
- Reduced resource competition
- Better monitoring control

2. Maintenance:
- Independent updates
- Reduced downtime
- Component-specific scaling
- Easier troubleshooting

3. Security:
- Isolated components
- Specific security policies
- Reduced attack surface
- Better access control
